# Student-Discipline-Grade-Assignment
An assignment on 3 weeks which gives an intro to classes in Python.
The main idea of the problem is to manage students in a faculty, as well as their grades at certain disciplines. Each student and each discipline has a name and a ID, and each grade has a valid Student ID and a valid Discipline ID, as well as the actual mark. 
Careful!!
If you want to automatically run this program, it will give you an import error as the Pyhton import functionality did not work entirely ok on my computer so I had to manually append the directories I needed. You can just delete those import and in will probably work.
